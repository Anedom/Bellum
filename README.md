## Playing
The conceptualization of Bellum gathers aspects from 3 different places: **War/Risk**, with the mechanics and rules; **War Games** *(movie)*, for the design/visuals; and **my sick head**, for all the fun, different and twisted aspects of the game.

As the game borrows its mechanics from War/Risk I wanted to preserve the feeling of board control, so even if the controls feel weird, they were designed to feel more mechanical than easy.

*So the best way is to just dive in and let the game take you away.*
